synopsis: In this episode, Arielle Kahn speaks with NOAA scientist Stephanie Herring
  about the impact of climate change on extreme weather events, the importance of
  definitions in climate research, and the intersection of science with real-world
  applications, including risk management.
key_topics:
- Extreme weather events
- Climate change attribution
- Risk management
- Socioeconomic impacts
tags:
- Climate Change
- Extreme Weather
- NOAA
key_points:
- Understanding the difference between global warming and climate change.
- The need for precise definitions in climate event research.
- The rise of research in climate change attribution and its implications for risk
  management.
segments:
- title: Introduction to Extreme Climate Events Series
  summary: The discussion kicks off with an introduction to the series focusing on
    extreme weather events and their socioeconomic impact.
  key_quotes:
  - quote: Building this bridge between the pure climate change science component
      and actually connecting that to why does it matter to the world.
    speaker: Arielle Kahn
    context: Setting the stage for the importance of discussing climate change effects.
- title: Defining Climate Change and Extreme Events
  summary: Stephanie Herring elaborates on the distinction between climate change
    and global warming, explaining the different definitions of extreme events.
  key_quotes:
  - quote: Global warming refers specifically to the fact that because human-caused
      activities can release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, it has caused a
      long-term warming trend across the planet.
    speaker: Stephanie Herring
    context: Clarifying terms related to climate change.
- title: Methodological Approaches in Climate Attribution
  summary: Discussion of the evolution of climate change attribution research and
    how it connects to risk management and socioeconomic factors.
  key_quotes:
  - quote: The way climate change attribution science works is that in general, the
      basic methodology is that you look at a world in a model where climate change
      has not occurred as a control plan.
    speaker: Stephanie Herring
    context: Explaining the scientific methodology used for climate attribution.
- title: Challenges in Attributing Climate Change to Events
  summary: Stephanie discusses the challenges of accurately attributing extreme weather
    events to climate change due to varying definitions and methodologies.
  key_quotes:
  - quote: It can make things a little bit tricky, but it also makes it, I think,
      more interesting because then you can really see where different methodological
      approaches have different benefits.
    speaker: Stephanie Herring
    context: Addressing the complexities in climate research.
- title: Urgency of Climate Action and Unknown Consequences
  summary: Arielle and Stephanie discuss the potential future impacts of climate change
    and the importance of taking action now to mitigate risks.
  key_quotes:
  - quote: '"The future is today. It''s happening now."'
    speaker: Stephanie Herring
    context: Emphasizing the urgency of addressing climate change.
