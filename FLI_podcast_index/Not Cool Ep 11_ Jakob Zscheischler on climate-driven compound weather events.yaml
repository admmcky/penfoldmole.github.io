  title: Earth System Scientist
  bio: Jakob Geschler is an earth system scientist who specializes in climate science,
    emphasizing compound weather events.
  expertise_areas:
  - Climate Science
  - Biogeochemistry
  - Statistical Approaches
synopsis: This episode features Jakob Geschler discussing the implications of climate-driven
  compound weather events, their increasing frequency due to climate change, and the
  challenges in modeling their impacts.
key_topics:
- Compound Weather Events
- Carbon Cycle
- Modeling Climate Risks
- Extreme Weather Events
tags:
- Climate Change
- Weather Events
- Environmental Science
key_points:
- Compound events, such as simultaneous droughts and heatwaves, can significantly
  affect carbon absorption rates.
- Current models may underestimate the risk of extreme weather if they ignore the
  correlation between different weather events.
- Transdisciplinary approaches are required to better study and mitigate the impacts
  of climate dynamics.
segments:
- title: Understanding the Carbon Cycle
  summary: Jakob discusses the carbon cycle and its vulnerability to climate change,
    particularly focusing on how droughts and heat impact carbon uptake.
  key_quotes:
  - quote: The land biosphere takes up a lot of carbon every year and also releases
      carbon.
    speaker: Jakob Geschler
    context: '"Discussion of the carbon cycle''s mechanisms and effects of climate
      change."'
- title: Extreme Weather Events
  summary: The conversation shifts to define extreme weather events, focusing on the
    risks posed by their combinations, such as droughts and heat.
  key_quotes:
  - quote: Extreme events occur in the tail of the distribution; above the 90th percentile,
      typically.
    speaker: Jakob Geschler
    context: Defining extreme weather events in the context of climate statistics.
- title: Predicting Future Risks
  summary: Jakob explains the need for better statistical models to predict risks
    associated with compound events.
  key_quotes:
  - quote: We need to ensure that our models represent the current risk of compound
      events adequately.
    speaker: Jakob Geschler
    context: Commenting on the challenges of modeling climate risks effectively.
- title: The Damocles Project
  summary: Jakob highlights the Damocles project, which aims to promote research collaboration
    on compound weather events.
  key_quotes:
  - quote: In Damocles, we try to bring together climate modelers, impact modelers,
      and stakeholders.
    speaker: Jakob Geschler
    context: Discussing the goals of the multi-disciplinary research project.
