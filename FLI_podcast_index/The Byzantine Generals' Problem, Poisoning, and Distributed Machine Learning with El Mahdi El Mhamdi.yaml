segments:
- title: '"Introduction to the Byzantine Generals'' Problem"'
  summary: The episode begins with an exploration of the classic thought experiment
    of the Byzantine Generals, illustrating decision-making challenges in distributed
    systems.
  key_quotes:
  - quote: '"When groups of computers or groups of generals are trying to check who
      is lying amongst discrepancies, if the corrupt group exceeds 33%, you provably
      cannot come up with an agreement."'
    speaker: El Mahdi El Mhamdi
    context: '"Discussing the implications of the Byzantine Generals'' Problem on
      consensus in distributed systems."'
- title: Byzantine Fault Tolerance in Machine Learning
  summary: The segment transitions to the relevance of Byzantine fault tolerance in
    machine learning, detailing how poisoning attacks can undermine system reliability.
  key_quotes:
  - quote: One single malicious agent can provably poison a distributed machine learning
      scheme.
