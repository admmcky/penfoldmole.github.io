segments:
- title: Introduction to Climate Change and Existential Risks
  summary: Arielle introduces the topic of climate change and the debate within the
    existential risk community about its classification as an existential threat or
    merely a significant challenge for humanity.
  key_quotes:
  - quote: '"There''s a lot of debate within the existential risk community about
      whether the climate crisis really does pose an existential threat."'
    speaker: Arielle Kahn
    context: Introduction segment on climate change impact.
- title: Understanding Risk Levels
  summary: The guests clarify terms regarding existential threats, catastrophic risks,
    and extreme risks, explaining their distinctions using scenarios.
  key_quotes:
  - quote: An existential risk is something where either everyone dies or you have
      an outcome which is an equivalent amount of harm.
    speaker: Simon Beard
    context: Discussion of terminology.
- title: Global Systems and Existential Threats
  summary: Discussion on how global systems operate and may fail under extreme conditions,
    including climate change.
  key_quotes:
  - quote: An extreme risk is one that pushes at least one of these systems outside
      of its normal boundaries.
    speaker: Simon Beard
    context: Risks associated with abnormal system behavior.
- title: Critiquing Climate Predictions
  summary: Simon critiques the methodology of making climate change predictions and
    the implications they hold for existential risk.
  key_quotes:
  - quote: If you look at it this way, then an extreme risk is one that pushes at
      least one of these systems outside of its normal boundaries of operation.
    speaker: Simon Beard
    context: Critique on predictions.
- title: Interconnected Nature of Threats
  summary: The discussion transitions to how climate change interrelates with other
    existential risks, such as nuclear threats and pandemics.
  key_quotes:
  - quote: Climate change is going to make a bunch of the hazards that we face more
      likely.
    speaker: Haydn Belfield
    context: Interconnected risks discussion.
- title: Innovative Research for Climate Threats
  summary: The guests emphasize the need for new research methodologies to understand
    the complexities of climate impacts on civilization.
  key_quotes:
  - quote: We need to create a safe sandbox for people who are concerned about this.
    speaker: Simon Beard
    context: Need for new research approaches.
