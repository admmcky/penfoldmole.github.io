synopsis: In this episode, Gus Dogger speaks with Alan Robock about the scientific
  implications of nuclear winter, its potential impacts on climate and agriculture,
  and the role of geoengineering as a response. The discussion covers historical events,
  international nuclear dynamics, and the urgent need for disarmament.
key_topics:
- Nuclear Winter
- Climate Change

tags:
- Nuclear Winter
- Climate Science
- Geoengineering
- Disarmament
key_points:
- Nuclear winter refers to the drastic climate changes following a nuclear war due
  to smoke and soot blocking sunlight.
- Historical examples, such as the eruption of Mount Tambora, illustrate potential
  agricultural collapses similar to those expected from nuclear winter.
- The majority of casualties from nuclear war would stem from global agricultural
  failures rather than immediate blasts.
- Disarming nuclear weapons is crucial to prevent nuclear winter from occurring.
