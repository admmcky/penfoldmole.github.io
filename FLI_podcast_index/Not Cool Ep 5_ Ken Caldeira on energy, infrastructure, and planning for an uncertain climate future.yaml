segments:
- title: Introduction to Climate Change
  summary: The host introduces the necessity of transitioning to a near-zero carbon
    emission energy system to counteract climate change.
  key_quotes:
  - quote: If we want to live on this planet for the long term and have an industrial
      economy, we need an energy system that has close to zero carbon emissions.
    speaker: Ken Caldeira
    context: Discussing the essential requirements for long-term sustainability.
- title: Energy Systems and Political Dynamics
  summary: Ken discusses the challenges of persuading policymakers and the importance
    of focusing on energy systems rather than trying to change beliefs.
  key_quotes:
