guests:
- name: Seth Baum
  affiliation: Global Catastrophic Risk Institute
  title: Executive Director
  bio: Seth Baum is the executive director of the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute,
    which focuses on understanding and mitigating potential global catastrophic risks.

  bio: Dr. Martin Chapman is a seismologist at Virginia Tech, specializing in earthquake
    risks and research.
  expertise_areas:
  - Seismology
  - Earthquake hazards
synopsis: In this episode, host Arielle Kahn, along with guests Seth Baum and Dr.
  Martin Chapman, explore whether catastrophic earthquakes can pose existential risks,
  discussing their potential global implications and historical examples.
key_topics:
- Existential risks
- Seismology
- Economic impacts of natural disasters
- Public health and biological release during disasters
tags:
- Earthquakes
- Existential risk
- Disaster management
- Global catastrophic risks
key_points:
- Determining the likelihood of earthquakes causing global catastrophic events is
  complex.
- Historical earthquakes like the Lisbon earthquake illustrate the potential widespread
  impact of seismic events.
- Natural disasters often have a more significant impact on underdeveloped regions
  due to structural vulnerabilities.
segments:
- title: Existential Risks of Earthquakes
  summary: The hosts and guests analyze whether an earthquake could lead to global
    catastrophe and discuss various scenarios.
  key_quotes:
  - quote: '"I don''t think we can categorically rule this one out, but I''m not losing
      sleep at night because it is one."'
    speaker: Seth Baum
    context: Discussing the plausibility of earthquakes causing existential risks.
- title: Regional Earthquake Risks
  summary: The discussion focuses on earthquake hazards in various regions, particularly
    around high-risk facilities.
  key_quotes:
  - quote: The hazard from a major earthquake in the Atlanta area would be in the
      same ballpark as you would expect for Washington or New York.
    speaker: Dr. Martin Chapman
    context: Exploring earthquake risk assessments in major US cities.
- title: Economic Resilience to Earthquakes
  summary: The guests examine how earthquakes can disrupt economies, especially in
    less resilient regions.

      to the whole global economy.
    speaker: Arielle Kahn
    context: Illustrating the ripple effects of natural disasters on global economic
      stability.
- title: Concluding Thoughts on Earthquake Risks
  summary: A synthesis of the discussion leading to the conclusion that while earthquakes
    pose risks, the likelihood of catastrophic global impacts is relatively low.
  key_quotes:
  - quote: The potential for earthquakes to cause a major global catastrophe seems
      like, yeah, probably not.
    speaker: Arielle Kahn
    context: Final reflections on the likelihood of earthquakes leading to existential
      risks.
