- title: Introduction to Geoengineering
  summary: The episode opens with a discussion about the climate crisis and introduces
    geoengineering as a possible temporary solution.
  key_quotes:
  - quote: '"Are the impacts of global warming going to be so serious that we might
      want to use this temporary thing, liken it to a tourniquet for a while before
      we can solve the problem?"'
    speaker: Arielle Kahn
    context: Host Arielle Kahn contextualizes the discussion on geoengineering.
- title: Understanding Geoengineering
  summary: Dr. Robock elaborates on the concept of geoengineering, its methods, and
    its feasibility, stressing the need for mitigation.
  key_quotes:
  - quote: '"Global warming is real. It''s caused by us. Overall, it''s going to be
      bad."'
    speaker: Dr. Alan Robock
    context: Dr. Robock emphasizes the reality of global warming.
- title: Geoengineering Techniques
  summary: '"The conversation delves into two primary methods of geoengineering: Carbon
    Dioxide Removal (CDR) and Solar Radiation Management (SRM)."'
  key_quotes:
  - quote: Geoengineering is really not a good term because it really means pushing
      Earth around.
