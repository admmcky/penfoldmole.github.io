  bio: Connor Leahy is the CEO of Conjecture, an organization focused on researching
    scalable AI alignment.
  expertise_areas:
  - AI alignment
  - Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
  - Cognitive science
synopsis: In this episode, Connor Leahy discusses the nuances of defining Artificial
  General Intelligence (AGI) and the evolution of human intelligence compared to chimpanzees.
  He shares insights on the future of AI progress, the importance of cooperation in
  intelligence, and the challenges of setting meaningful benchmarks for AI development.
key_topics:
- Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
- Human vs. Chimpanzee Intelligence
- AI progress and timelines
- Benchmarks in AI development
- Memetics and information sharing
tags:
- Artificial Intelligence
- Cognitive Science
- Evolution
- AI Safety
key_points:
- AGI is characterized by systems that can learn and innovate beyond current capabilities.
- Humans and chimpanzees differ not just in intelligence but also in social cooperation.
- Benchmarks for AI progress can be misleading; they often serve more as coordination
  technologies than scientific tools.
- '"Understanding memetics is crucial for AI''s learning and development."'
