segments:
- title: Anthrax Epidemic of 1979
  summary: The discussion focuses on the Sverdlovsk anthrax epidemic, exploring the
    nature of anthrax and the difficulties in confirming whether it was a result of
    an airborne infection or meat consumption.
  key_quotes:
  - quote: It was probable that it was inhalation and not ingestion.
    speaker: Matthew Meselson
    context: Discussing evidence from the 1979 anthrax epidemic.
- title: Agent Orange and Its Impact
  summary: '"Matthew Meselson shares insights from his investigations into the use
    of herbicides in Vietnam, particularly Agent Orange, discussing its effects and
    the military''s perspective."'
  key_quotes:
  - quote: The herbicides helped us lose the war, not win it.
    speaker: Matthew Meselson
    context: Discussing the military utility of herbicides in the Vietnam War.
- title: Debunking the Yellow Rain Myths
  summary: The episode explores the yellow rain controversy, highlighting how initial
    assumptions about its nature were proven incorrect.
  key_quotes:
  - quote: '"The whole story collapsed and we''ve written a long account of this."'
    speaker: Matthew Meselson
    context: Summarizing the findings regarding yellow rain as bee feces rather than
      a chemical weapon.
