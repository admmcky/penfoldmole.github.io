  - Ocean acidification
  - Marine ecology
  - Public policy
synopsis: In this episode, Libby Jewett discusses the complex phenomenon of ocean
  acidification and its significant impacts on marine ecosystems and industries, particularly
  in relation to rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere.
key_topics:
- Ocean acidification
- Impact of CO2 on marine life
- '"NOAA''s research and role"'
- Climate change
tags:
- ocean acidification
- marine science
- climate change
key_points:
- Ocean acidification results from increased CO2 in the atmosphere, affecting ocean
  chemistry.
- NOAA is actively involved in monitoring and researching the impacts of ocean acidification.
- There are variations in the effects of ocean acidification and temperature increases
  around the globe.
